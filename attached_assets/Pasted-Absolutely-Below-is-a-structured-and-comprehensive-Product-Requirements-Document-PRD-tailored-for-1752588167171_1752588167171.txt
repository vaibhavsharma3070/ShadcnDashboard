🛍️ Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Title: Consignment Management System for Pre-Owned Luxury Items Owner: Salomón Cohen Status: MVP

1. Business Context
1.1 Business Overview
The company specializes in the resale of pre-owned luxury goods such as watches, handbags, and fashion accessories. Items are sourced from individual vendors who consign their goods with the company. The company markets these items, sells them to end clients, and takes a commission from each transaction.
1.2 Business Model Summary
Stakeholder	Role
Vendor	Supplies a luxury item and agrees on a fixed payout (consignment price).
Company	Markets, stores, sells the item, manages payments, and handles logistics.
Client	Purchases the item, either in full or through partial payments.
Flow:
1. Vendor consignment agreement is created (vendor price + listing price).
2. Item is stored and made available for sale.
3. A client pays in full or via instalments.
4. When fully paid, the item is delivered to the client and the vendor is paid.
5. Profit = listing price − vendor payout − item-related expenses.
1.3 Business Rules
* Items may require authentication or repairs, incurring expenses.
* Clients can pay in multiple instalments.
* Vendors are only paid once the item is fully paid by the client.
* Profit is calculated per item as: client payments - vendor payout - item expenses

2. Product Objective
Build a Retool-based internal web application that enables store operators, finance staff, and the business owner to:
* Register vendors and clients
* Log item intake and status
* Track client payments (partial or full)
* Register vendor payouts
* Record item-related expenses
* Monitor profitability in real-time

3. Functional Scope
3.1 Features Overview
Feature	Description
Vendor Management	Add, view, and search vendor records.
Client Management	Add, view, and search client records.
Item Intake	Register new items, associate them with vendors, and set pricing.
Client Payments	Log partial or full payments from clients toward specific items.
Vendor Payouts	Record the amount paid to vendors upon successful sale.
Item Expenses	Record costs such as authentication and repairs.
Profitability Dashboard	View real-time KPIs including profit, sales, outstanding payouts.
5. Data Model
5.1 Tables
Table	Description
vendor	Stores vendor info (ID, name, contact, tax ID, created date).
client	Stores client info (ID, name, contact, billing address, created date).
item	Core business object. Linked to vendor, holds acquisition data, pricing, and status.
client_payment	Records instalment payments from clients for specific items.
vendor_payout	Records amount paid to the vendor after the item is sold.
item_expense	Tracks item-related expenses and their type.
Note: Data types are uuid (as PK), numeric(12,2) for money, timestamptz for dates. See full DDL below.

-- See prior DDL script with uuid_generate_v4(), no ENUMs or DOMAINs
-- Tables: vendor, client, item, client_payment, vendor_payout, item_expense
-- With correct indexes and foreign keys

7. Smart Behaviors to Implement
Trigger	Action
Client payments ≥ list_price	Auto-update item status to sold
Item marked sold, vendor payout = 0	Show in vendor payout queue
Item expense added	Recalculate profit dynamically
New payment added	Append to client_payment, recalc balance
11. Non-Functional Requirements
* Must be fast and responsive across all Retool components
* All actions should be auditable (by user, time, and item)
